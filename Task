Question:  List five differences between Browser JS(Console) vs NodeJS.
Answer:
	        	      Browser JS(Console)						     NodeJS
	        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	        1. Browsers processes response objects.				       1. Node processes request object.
	   	2. Moduling is not mandatory in client side                  	       2. In Node everything is a module,
	           JavaScript, i.e., in browsers.                                         you must keep your code inside a module.
	        3. Window is a predefined global object which has 		       3. Node doesn't have a predefined "window" object
	           functions and attributes.						  because it doesn't have a window to draw anything.
	        4. Location is another predefined object in browsers,		       4. Location" object is related to a particular url,		       
	           that has all the information about the url we have     		  it is for page specific. So, node doesn't require
	           loaded. 								  that.							          
	        5. Browsers are not headless.					       5. Node is headless.						       
          
          
Question:  How does the browser actually render a website
Summary:  
           1.	Parsing a CSS or HTML that creates a dom tree
           2.	The dom tree then gets converted into a render tree
           3.	It's actually 4 trees. 
                    a). Render objects. 
                    b). Render styles.
                    c). Render layers.
                    d). Line boxes.
          4. Layout will parse and computes the elements, appearing on the page based on the installation to draw the elements by taking the 
             call of the CSS and then give the value, position, and image.
             It will arrange the setup based on the changes made. like when we change the font size of a document the entire arrangement of
             document changes likewise based on the changes  layout will rearrange the layouts.
          5. Painting computes bitmaps and composites the formate which we expect on the page
                Note:*Use always script tag at the bottom 
                     *Parse will not get interrupted
                     *It will become easy and faster to render
                     
                     
Question:  Execute the below code and write your description in txt file
Answer:
           a. typeof(1)          -> number
           b. typeof(1.1)        -> number
           c. typeof('1.1')      -> string
           d. typeof(true)       -> boolean
           e. typeof(null)       -> object
           f. typeof(undefined)  -> undefined
           g. typeof([])         -> object
           h. typeof({})         -> object
           i. typeof(NaN)        -> number
